# **Text Processing Task** (_Part 1_)

## Setup

- Run `chmod +x unlock`

## Task Description

- You have 5 levels. Each level's answer is the key that you will use to unlock the next level.
- For example, level one asks for the number of employees on leave. This number is the key you'll use to unlock level 2, and so on.
- To unlock a level, run `./unlock level-x.md.enc`

## Submission Guidelines

- In the [Form](https://forms.gle/r2s3QR1xyhr9hEAr9), submit the final key (level 5), along with all the commands used to solve the task.

## Notes

- Your command should yield **only** the required answer, nothing else.
- Keys are case-sensitive.
- It might help to look at the content of the files beforehand to become familiar with their formats.
